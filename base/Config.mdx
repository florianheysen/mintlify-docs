You can change the config in this file, it will be populated across the app:


```tsx config/site.ts
export const siteConfig = {
  name: "Brink",
  description: "Collaborate, manage projects, and reach new productivity peaks",
};

export const MAX_FREE_VIEWS = 4;
export const PRO_SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE = 2000;

```
